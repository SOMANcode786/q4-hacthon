# Gazebo Simulation Environment

This module covers Gazebo, a physics-based simulation environment that enables accurate modeling of robot dynamics, sensors, and environments for humanoid robotics development.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand Gazebo's physics engine and capabilities
- Learn to create and configure simulation environments
- Model robot sensors and their outputs
- Integrate Gazebo with ROS 2 for robot simulation

## Content Coming Soon

This content is currently under development for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course.
