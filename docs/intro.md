# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This book explores the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems, where digital intelligence meets the real world through embodied agents.

## What You'll Learn

In this book, you'll explore:

- **Embodied Intelligence**: How AI systems operate in physical environments
- **ROS 2**: The robotic nervous system that connects hardware and software
- **Digital Twins**: Simulation environments for testing and training
- **AI-Robot Brains**: How NVIDIA Isaac transforms robotics with AI
- **Vision-Language-Action Systems**: Multimodal intelligence for robots
- **Humanoid Robotics**: The challenges and solutions for bipedal robots
- **RAG Chatbots**: How to build AI assistants for robotics education

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Computer Science and AI students (intermediate to advanced level)
- Developers learning ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac for humanoid control
- Researchers exploring embodied intelligence
- Engineers building AI-driven humanoid navigation and autonomy

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this book, you should have:
- Basic programming experience (Python preferred)
- Understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with robotics concepts (helpful but not required)
- Access to a computer capable of running ROS 2 and simulation environments

## Book Structure

The book is organized into 8 modules, each building on the previous:

1. **Introduction to Physical AI** - Foundational concepts
2. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Core robotics framework
3. **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Simulation environments
4. **The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - AI-powered robotics
5. **Vision-Language-Action Systems (VLA)** - Multimodal robotics
6. **Humanoid Robotics Architecture** - Bipedal robot design
7. **RAG Chatbot Integration** - AI assistant for learning
8. **Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid** - Complete project

## How to Use This Book

Each module includes:
- Theoretical concepts with practical examples
- Hands-on exercises with runnable code
- Diagrams and visualizations
- APA-cited sources for deeper learning
- Integration with our RAG chatbot for additional support

## Technical Requirements

To run the examples in this book, you'll need:
- Ubuntu 20.04 or later (recommended)
- Python 3.8+
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill
- Docker for containerized examples
- NVIDIA GPU (optional, for Isaac Sim acceleration)

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to establish the foundational concepts, then progress through each module sequentially. The capstone project in Module 8 brings together all concepts into a complete autonomous humanoid robot system.
